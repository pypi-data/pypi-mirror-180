For users:

* Read and interact with docstrings.
* Render them to markdown or html.
* Crosslink to generated documentation.

For developers:

* Easy to extend / create new renderers.
* Simple: each step of the process is explained in detail, so you can use a single
  part (e.g. render a docstring to markdown) if you want.
