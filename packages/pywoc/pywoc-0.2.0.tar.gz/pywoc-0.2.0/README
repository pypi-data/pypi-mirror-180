Install
-------

python -m pip install git+https://github.com/csabiu/WOC.git

or

pip install pywoc

Running
-------

from pywoc import woc

woc(map1,map2,radii, mask=mask)

- map1 is the 2D array of pixel values

- map2 should be same shape as map1

- radii is the array of radius values used to select the contours from map1 eg [100,200,300] in pixel units

- optional: mask is the array used to mask both maps (0=masked, 1=unmasked)
