## Requirements

### Python
Python ≥3.9 is required. An older version of Python will not work.

## Usage
To install the package, run:

    $ pip install dagdshort

Usage example:
```python
>>> import dagdshort

# Setup
>>> shortener = dagdshort.Shortener(user_agent_suffix='<YourGitUsername>/<YourGitRepoName>', max_cache_size=256)

# Shorten
>>> long_urls = ['https://github.com/impredicative/dagdshort/', 'https://pypi.org/project/dagdshort/']
>>> shortener.shorten_urls(long_urls)
{'https://github.com/impredicative/dagdshort/': 'https://da.gd/W9s06',
 'https://pypi.org/project/dagdshort/': 'https://da.gd/KtGTB'}

# Show cache info
>>> shortener.cache_info
{'Shortener._shorten_url': CacheInfo(hits=0, misses=2, maxsize=256, currsize=2)}
```

To obtain the fastest response, URLs must be shortened together in a batch as in the examples above.
Up to 8 concurrent workers are automatically used. The max limit can, if really necessary, be changed by setting `config.MAX_WORKERS` before initializing the shortener.

## Errors
If a "Blacklisted long URL" error is experienced for a reasonable website which should not be blacklisted, it can be reported [here](https://github.com/dagd/dagd/issues). As an example, see [this](https://github.com/dagd/dagd/issues/50) issue.
