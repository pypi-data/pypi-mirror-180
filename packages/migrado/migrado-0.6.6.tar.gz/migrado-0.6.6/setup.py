Make sure you understand how it operates.\n\nIf you have trouble, open an issue. Contributions are welcome.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMigrado requires Python 3.6 or higher, and the ArangoDB `arangosh` client.\n\n```bash\n$ pip install --user migrado\n```\n\nIt is also available as a Docker image, see [Docker usage](#docker-usage).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nMigrado can create a migrations directory and generate an initial set of collections from a given schema file:\n\n```bash\n$ migrado init --schema schema.yml\n```\n\nMigrado can also construct an initial migration from the current database structure (and automatically store it as the current state/schema):\n\n```bash\n$ migrado init --infer\n```\n\nSee [YAML schemas](#yaml-schemas) for details. If neither option is specified, Migrado will create an empty initial migration.\n\nTo autogenerate a schema migration script based on an updated schema:\n\n```bash\n$ migrado make --schema updated_schema.yml\n```\n\nTo make a new template data migration script:\n\n```bash\n$ migrado make --name rewrite_field_names\n```\n\nThis will create a new file, `migrations/0002_rewrite_field_names.js` (`--name` is optional), which you can edit as you see fit. See [Migration scripts](#migration-scripts) for details.\n\nWhen you are ready, run all migrations (not previously ran) against the database: \n\n```bash\n$ migrado run\n```\n\nMigrado stores migration state in a configurable collection, see `--help` or [Environment vars](#environment-vars) for details.\n\nIf you wrote a `reverse()` migration, you can revert to an earlier point by specifying a target migration id. To revert to the initial migration:\n\n```bash\n$ migrado run --target 0001\n```\n\nYou can inspect the current migration state with:\n\n```bash\n$ migrado inspect\n```\n\nYou can inspect the current schema (explicit or inferred) with:\n\n```bash\n$ migrado export\n```\n\nUse the `--help` option for help on any command when using the client.\n\nDocker usage\n------------\n\nIf you\'re using Migrado in a Docker context, you might as well use the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/protojour/migrado). `migrado` is set as entrypoint, so the image can be used like the Python client:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run protojour/migrado --help\n```\n\nYou\'d want to volume in your migrations folder:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -v /path/to/migrations:/app/migrations protojour/migrado\n```\n\nOr, an example using docker-compose:\n\n```yaml\nmigrado:\n  image: protojour/migrado:latest\n  environment:\n    MIGRADO_DB: # ...\n    MIGRADO_HOST: # ...\n  volumes:\n    - ./migrations:/app/migrations\n```\n\nThen either add a `command:` (with a migrado sub-command, e.g. `command: run ...`), or use this as a starting point for a scripted migration strategy.\n\nYou may also use the base [Dockerfile](https://github.com/protojour/migrado/blob/master/Dockerfile) as a starting point.\n\nEnvironment vars\n----------------\n\nThe following environment variables are employed by Migrado:\n\n- `MIGRADO_PATH`: Specifies the path to the migrations directory, replaces `-p`, `--path` (default: `migrations`).\n- `MIGRADO_DB`: Specifies the ArangoDB database name for generated migrations to interact with, replaces `-d`, `--db` (no default, but required for the `run` command).\n- `MIGRADO_COLL`: Specifies ArangoDb collection name to store migration state in, replaces `-c`, `--state-coll` (default: `migrado`).\n- `MIGRADO_TLS`: Use TLS for connection when running migrations, replaces `-T`, `--tls` (default: `False`).\n- `MIGRADO_HOST`: Specifies the database host for running migrations, replaces `-H`, `--host` (default: `localhost`).\n- `MIGRADO_PORT`: Specifies the database port for running migrations, replaces `-P`, `--port` (default: `8529`).\n- `MIGRADO_USER`: Specifies the database username for running migrations, replaces `-U`, `--username` (no default).\n- `MIGRADO_PASS`: Specifies the database password for running migrations, replaces `-W`, `--password` (no default).\n\nYAML schemas\n------------\n\nArangoDB may be schemaless, but in a larger project it still makes sense to keep a schema spec up to date, both for an overview of collections and their data structures, and as a basis for [native collection-level validation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/3.9/data-modeling-documents-schema-validation.html) (see the `-v/--validation` option).\n\nMigrado uses a schema model based on JSON Schema, in YAML, and can use this to generate an initial migration for the collections available in your database.\n\nExample schema:\n\n```yaml\nall: &all\n  _id:\n    type: string\n    readOnly: true\n  _key:\n    type: string\n    readOnly: true\n  _rev:\n    type: string\n    readOnly: true\n\nedges: &edges\n  _from:\n    type: string\n  _to:\n    type: string\n\ncollections:\n\n  books:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      <<: *all\n      title:\n        type: string\n      isbn:\n        type: string\n    required:\n      - title\n      - isbn\n\n  authors:\n    # Note: you do not actually need to specify an object schema,\n    # but the schema can be used with ArangoDB\'s native validation \n    # using the -v/--validation option\n\nedge_collections:\n\n  # authors --> books \n  author_of:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      <<: *all\n      <<: *edges\n    required:\n      - _from\n      - _to\n```\n\nMigration scripts\n-----------------\n\nMigration scripts are structured so they may be parsed and run easily by both Migrado and ArangoDB. In addition, they are structured so they may be run manually against ArangoDB using `arangosh`.\n\nThere are two types of script, **data** and **schema** migration scripts.\n\n### Data migrations\n\nYou need to declare all collections subject to write operations using the syntax `// write collection_name`, because ArangoDB needs this information for locking during transactions. We\'ve made the declaration explicit to reduce errors. _Attempting to write to collections not declared in this way will cause the migration to fail._\n\nIn general, a reverse migration should do the logical opposite of a forward migration. `forward()` and `reverse()` functions can contain anything that the ArangoDB V8 engine understands, but must be fully self-contained. _Anything outside these functions is ignored and unavailable when running migrations._\n\nHere\'s an example migration script for adding `new_field` in collection `things`:\n\n```javascript\n// write things\n\nfunction forward() {\n    var db = require("@arangodb").db\n    db._query(`\n        FOR thing IN things\n            UPDATE thing WITH { new_field: "some value" } IN things\n    `)\n}\n\nfunction reverse() {\n    var db = require("@arangodb").db\n    db._query(`\n        FOR thing IN things\n            REPLACE thing WITH UNSET(thing, "new_field") IN things\n    `)\n}\n```\n\nPlease make sure you read [limitations when running transactions](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/transactions-limitations.html) in the ArangoDB documentation. In particular, _creation and deletion of databases, collections, and indexes_ is not allowed in transactions.\n\n### Schema migrations\n\nSchema migrations are stuctured in the same way as data migrations, but are run against `arangosh` as opposed to the HTTP API. There is no transaction safety when running schema migrations.\n\nSchema migrations are structured the same way as data migrations, but `// write` declarations are not required. All operations are allowed.\n\nHere\'s an example migration script generated from the YAML schema above (with no validation):\n\n```javascript\nfunction forward() {\n    var db = require("@arangodb").db\n    var schema = // schema to be written to disk\n    db._create("books", {}, "document")\n    db._create("authors", {}, "document")\n    db._create("author_of", {}, "edge")\n}\n\nfunction reverse() {\n    var db = require("@arangodb").db\n    db._drop("books")\n    db._drop("authors")\n    db._drop("author_of")\n}\n```\n\nPlease be careful when running schema migrations in reverse. As you can see, the `reverse()` function above would drop your collections (and lose your data) if you were to reverse beyond this point. Currently, you will not be able to do so for an initial migration.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMigrado is copyright Â© 2019 Protojour AS, and is licensed under MIT.
