    'long_description': '# poeblix\nPoetry Plugin that adds various features that extend the `poetry` command such as building wheel files with locked dependencies, and validations of wheel/docker containers.\n\nSupports poetry versions `1.2+`\n\n# Overview\nThese contain custom poetry plugins that enable functionality not available in the official distribution of poetry.  These include:\n\n1. Using the Lock file to build a wheel file with pinned dependencies\n2. Support for data_files (like with setup.py) such as jupyter extensions or font files\n3. Validating a wheel file is consistent with dependencies specified in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock\n4. Validating a docker container\'s `pip freeze` contains dependencies as specified in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock\n\nThese are not supported in Poetry due to debate in the community: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/890, https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4013, https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2778\n\n## Deterministic builds and environments\n\nPoetry guarantees deterministic installations and environments thanks\nto the `poetry.lock` file, which is where it stores the exact versions\nof all the dependencies needed to install a package. However, this doesn\'t\noccurs when wheel or package artifacts are build using `poetry build`\ncommand.\n\nTo build a package, poetry uses the direct dependencies set in the\n`pyproject.toml` and not all the other dependencies required to install\na package. For example, if `pyproject.toml` defines `pandas = "1.4.2"`\nas dependency but `poetry.lock` also says that `pandas` requires of\n`numpy-1.22.4`, poetry will build a package with `pandas` as dependency\nbut not with `numpy`.\n\nAnother problem that exists is that `pyproject.toml` can contain dependencies\nwith ranges of versions while `poetry.lock` has pinned versions. For instance,\nif `pyproject.toml` has as dependency `pandas = ">=1.3"` but `poetry.lock`\nsets `pandas-1.4.2`, poetry will build a package with the dependency\n`Requires-Dist: pandas (>=0.1.3,<0.2.0)`. When the package is installed,\nthe resolver will install the newest package of `pandas` which its version\nnumber is greater than or equal to `0.1.3` and lower than `0.2.0`.\n\nSumming this up, the same python package created with `poetry build` and\ninstalled several times won\'t install the same dependencies, making impossible\nto have deterministic installations.\n\nThis plugin solves these problems building python packages that use the\ndependencies defined in the `poetry.lock`.\n\n\n# How to Use\n\n### Prerequisite\n\nPoetry Plugins are only supported in 1.2.0+ which, at the moment (5/29/22), can only be installed when using the [new poetry installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)\n\n```commandline\n# You can update poetry using\npoetry self update\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can add the plugin via poetry\'s CLI:\n\n```commandline\npoetry plugin add poeblix\n```\n\nOr install directly from source/wheel, then add with the same above command using the absolute path to the built dist\n\nTo update the plugin:\n\n```commandline\n# Update to latest\npoetry plugin add poeblix@latest\n\n# Update to specific version\npoetry plugin add poeblix==<version>\n```\n\nYou should now see the blix* commands if you run `poetry list`\n\n## Usage\n\n1. To build a wheel from your package (pyproject.toml dependencies have precedence over poetry.lock ones, by default)\n\n```commandline\npoetry blixbuild\n\n# Note: Options below are also available as part of the `blixvalidatewheel` and `blixvalidatedocker` commands\n\n# To disable using lock file for building wheel and only use pyproject.toml\npoetry blixbuild --no-lock\n\n# Uses lock dependencies only which are pinned to exact versions, instead of pyproject.toml\npoetry blixbuild --only-lock\n\n# Specify additional dependency groups to include as Requires-Dist in the wheel\npoetry blixbuild --with-groups=dev,integ,etc.\n```\n\n\n2. Validate a wheel file has consistent dependencies and data_files as specified in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock\n\n```commandline\npoetry blixvalidatewheel <path-to-wheel>\n\n# Disable using lock file for validation\npoetry blixvalidatewheel --no-lock <path-to-wheel>\n```\n\n_Note: this validates consistency in both directions_\n\n3. Validate a docker container contains dependencies in a `pip freeze` as specified in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock\n\n```commandline\npoetry blixvalidatedocker <docker-container-ID>\n\n# Disable using lock file for validation\npoetry blixvalidatedocker --no-lock <docker-container-ID>\n```\n\n_Note: this only validates the docker container contains dependencies in the project, but not the other direction_\n\nHere\'s an example series of commands to start up a temporary docker container using its tag, validate it, then stop the temporary container\n\n```\n# This will output the newly running container id\ndocker run --entrypoint=bash -it -d <docker-image-tag>\n\n# Then validate the running docker container, and stop it when done\npoetry blixvalidatedocker <container-id>\ndocker stop <container-id>\n```\n\n4. Adding data_files to pyproject.toml to mimic data_files in setup.py:\n\n```yaml\n...\n\n[tool.blix.data]\ndata_files = [\n    { destination = "share/data/", from = [ "data_files/test.txt", "data_files/anotherfile" ] },\n    { destination = "share/data/threes", from = [ "data_files/athirdfile" ] }\n]\n\n...\n```\n\ndata_files should be under the `[tool.blix.data]` category and is a list of objects, each containing the `destination` data folder, and a `from` list of files to add to the destination data folder.\n\n_Note: the destination is a relative path that installs data to relative to the [installation prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files)_\n\nExample: https://github.com/spoorn/poeblix/blob/main/test/positive_cases/happy_case_example/pyproject.toml\n\n5. For more help on each command, use the --help argument\n\n```commandline\npoetry blixbuild --help\npoetry blixvalidatewheel --help\npoetry blixvalidatedocker --help\n```\n\n# Development\n\n```bash\n# Make a virtual environment on Python 3.9\n# If using virtualenvwrapper, run `mkvirtualenv -p python3.9 venv`\nvirtualenv -p python3.9 venv\n\n# Or activate existing virtualenv\n# If using virtualenvwrapper, run `workon venv`\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# installs the plugin in editable mode for easier testing via `poetry install`\n./devtool bootstrap\n\n# Lint checks\n./devtool lint\n\n# Tests\n./devtool test\n\n# Run all checks and tests\n./devtool all\n```\n\n**plugins.py** : contains our plugin that adds the `poetry blixbuild` command for building our wheel file\n\n**validatewheel.py**: adds a `poetry blixvalidatewheel` command that validates a wheel file contains the Required Dist as specified in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock\n\n**validatedocker.py** : adds a command that validates a docker file contains dependencies as specified in pyproject.toml and poetry.lock.  This does *NOT* validate that they are exactly matching, but rather that all dependencies in pyproject.toml/poetry.lock exist in the docker container on the correct versions.  The docker image may contain more extra dependencies\n',
