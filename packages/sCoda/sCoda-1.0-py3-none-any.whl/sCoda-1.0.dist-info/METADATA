# sCoda

sCoda is a Python library for handling MIDI files.
sCoda supports a plethora of different MIDI manipulation operations, such as:

- quantisation of notes
- quantisation of notelengths
- splitting sequences into bars
- transposing of sequences
- creating piano-roll visualisations of pieces
- judging the difficulty of pieces

sCoda was used in our project [PAUL-2](https://github.com/FelixSchoen/PAUL-2) to process MIDI files.
For information about how to use sCoda we refer to chapter 5 of the [thesis](https://github.com/FelixSchoen/PAUL-2/blob/main/DiplomaThesis.pdf) in which sCoda was introduced.
