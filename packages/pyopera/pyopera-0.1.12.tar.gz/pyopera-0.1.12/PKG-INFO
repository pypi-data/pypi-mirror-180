TODO: Test TestPypi package locally  
TODO: Benchmarking with airspeed velocity (struggling to make it work without a setup.py)  
TODO: Don't repeat the library name in the Dockerfile  
~~TODO: Find out how to trigger the docker image build step when the file changes~~
TODO: Start adding the wrapper code and files - in progress  
TODO: Add actual documentation in this readme  
TODO: Automate versioning  
~~TODO: Struggling to run commands inside Docker from the host, will run commands from inside container for now~~  
~~TODO: Add the original library folder into the folder structure  (manual for now, eventually upload it as a build artifact or similar)~~  
~~TODO: poetry is not including the additional files with the library~~  
~~TODO: Fully install poetry in the container (maybe use the long name as a variable for now)~~  
~~TODO: Create CI/CD for package in TestPypi and the prod Pypi (CircleCI maybe?)~~  
~~TODO: Documentation using Sphinx (make sure original repo/builders are credited)~~  
~~TODO: Auto semantic versioning with poetry too~~    
~~TODO: Create a python package around the Matlab package (the base files) using Poetry~~  
~~TODO: Formatting/Linting/Coverage~~  
~~TODO: Choose between Pytest an Unittest~~  
~~TODO: Automate black, isort, pylint, coverage, pytest on build or push. - just have to finish coverage~~  
~~TODO: Auto docstring generating? -- used autodocstring extension for vscode~~  
~~TODO: How to autobuild the base image the CI/CD will work with - could not be done~~
