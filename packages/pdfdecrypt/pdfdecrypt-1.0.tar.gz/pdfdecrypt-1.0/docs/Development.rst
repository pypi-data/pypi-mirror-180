Seting up a `pdfdecrypt` Development Environment
--------------------------------------------------

Create a virtual environment somewhere. Lets call it `_venv`::

   python -m venv _venv

Activate our environment::

  source _venv/bin/activate

Install packages required for development::

  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Install `pdfdecrypt` in editable mode (i.e. setuptools "develop mode")::

  python -m pip install -e .

Going back to your non-virtual environment::

  deactivate

Run `pdfdecrypt` without activating the virtual environment::

  _venv/bin/pdfdecrypt â€¦


See `Virtual Environments and Packages`__ tutorial
in the official Python documentation for more details.
