## Distribution of Tasks

- [User Interaction](#User-Interaction)
- [Differentiation](#Differentiation)
- [Visualization](#Visualization)
- [Testing Suite](#Testing-Suite)

### User Interaction
**Aaron** will handle the interaction with the user, which includes the `main.py` file and the `construct` sub-package, which includes the `function_tree.py` and `node.py` files.

### Differentiation
**Ream** and **Alex** will handle the `differentiate` sub-package, which includes implementing Dual Numbers (in `dual_number.py`) and forward and reverse pass (in `forward_pass.py` and `reverse_pass.py`).

### Visualization
**Jack** will handle the `visualize` sub-package, which includes the `graph_tree.py` file and any other visualizations we find are practical and useful.

### Testing Suite
**Eli** will lead the testing suite (the `test` sub-package) and all of its unit and other tests. **Jack** will also assist with the testing suite, since the workload may be very high (especially in the beginning for creating black box tests).


## Progress
Before the deadline for Milestone 2B, each group member will have completed the outlines for their part of the package. This outline includes creating the Python files, classes, and functions. No implementation for these will be completed yet, so all functions will just `pass` for now.

This will allow us to have a better idea of our own workloads and re-distribute tasks if needed.
