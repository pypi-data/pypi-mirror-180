xorange Sphinx Theme
====================

A `Sphinx theme`_ for xorange's documentation, based on `Read The Docs`_'
default theme (sphinx_rtd_theme_).

Installation
------------

This theme is distributed on PyPI as xorange-sphinx-theme_ and can be
installed with ``pip``:

.. code:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install xorange-sphinx-theme

To use the theme in your Sphinx project, you will need to add the following to
your ``conf.py`` file:

.. code:: python

    html_theme = "xorange-sphinx-theme"

This theme is based on sphinx_rtd_theme_ and accepts most of the same
`configuration options`_ settable via ``html_theme_option`` and a few
additional options as well:

:logo: Boolean determining if the xorange logo should be displayed.
       Defaults to true.

:logo_link: URL to use for the logo's link.  Defaults to
            <https://docs.xorange.org>.

:logo_only: Ignored.  Inherited from sphinx_rtd_theme_.  Instead, the project
            name and version info will not be displayed (thus showing only the
            logo) when ``subproject`` is true.

:subproject: Boolean determining if this is a subproject of the main xorange
             documentation project on <https://docs.xorange.org>.  Defaults
             to true.

If your project wants to display its own logo, just set Sphinx's ``html_logo``
to point to the image file in your Sphinx project.

.. code:: python

    html_logo = "_static/your-logo.png"

This will automatically take precedence over the default xorange logo
provided by the theme.

Development
-----------

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m pip install -e .
    make clean # not always needed, but better to be cautious
    make html
    open build/html/index.html
