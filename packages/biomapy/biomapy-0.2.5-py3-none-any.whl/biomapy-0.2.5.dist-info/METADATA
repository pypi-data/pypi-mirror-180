This is a library that has just one function that maps a list of gene IDs from one to another. Supported IDs are Uniprot, entrez, ensembl, and symbol. The usage is straightforward the gene_mapping_many() takes as argument the list of IDs, source IDs and target IDs. The function update_datasets() will update the map datasets directly from uniprot and ncbidb. Future implementations will focus on expanding the possibility of mapping between IDs.
