        Web Server Base Library (WSBLib), a library that serves as a basis for creating other web server frameworks in Python. The goal is to be simple, fast and secure.
        
        To create server frameworks, you need to use this library and the [HTTPPyParser](https://github.com/jaedsonpys/http-pyparser) library to get data from the request, as it is your framework that will manage the entire request cycle, the `WSBLib` library just makes it easier for you.
