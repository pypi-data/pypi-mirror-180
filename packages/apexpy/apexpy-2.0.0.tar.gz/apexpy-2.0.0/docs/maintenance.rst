Package Maintenance
===================

Providing Wheels with Releases
------------------------------

The Continuous Integration (CI) now saves wheels created for each tested Python
version and computer Operating System (OS) as artifacts. When preparing a new
PyPi release, these wheels may be downloaded from the release candidate.  We
currently don't include them, because the wheels only work when the installation
environment mirrors the CI environment.

Updating IGRF
-------------

The `International Geomagnetic Reference Field <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html>`_
is regularly updated to reflect the most recent changes to the Terrestrial
magnetic field. apexpy currently uses IRGF-13 coefficients, which are provided
in the ``apexpy/src/apexpy/igrf13coeff.txt`` file. To change or update the
magnetic field coefficients used by apexpy, you need to update the python code.
Assuming your new coefficient file has the same format, the process is simple:

1. Clone the repository or your fork of the repository (see :ref:`contributing`)
2. Update ``apexpy/src/apexpy/apex.py`` variable ``igrf_fn`` by setting
   it equal to the new target filename
3. Install the python package from the command line
   (see :ref:`installation-cmd`)

Updating ``apexsh.dat``
-----------------------

After updating the IGRF coefficients file the ``apexsh.dat`` file needs to be
rebuilt. This file is what makes apexpy performant. For more details, see
Emmert et al. [2010] [1]_.

Updating ``apexsh.dat`` is done by modifying and building the fortran source
code in the ``apexpy/src/fortranapex`` directory. Working in that directory:

1. Make sure a copy of the latest IGRF coefficient file is present in the
   selfsame directory.
2. Modify the ``igrffilein`` in ``checkapexsh.f90`` to the name of the IGRF
   coefficient file (``igrf13coeff.txt``, for example).
3. Modify ``checkapexsh.f90`` by adding the next 5 year epoch to the
   ``epochgrid`` variable and updating the ``nepochgrid`` variable as
   necessary. For example, if the newest IGRF coefficients are good up to 2025
   and ``epochgrid`` only has up to the year 2020, then add 2025 to
   ``epochgrid`` and then increment ``nepochgrid`` by 1.
4. Build the ``apextest`` binary by running the ``make`` command.
5. Copy the IGRF coefficient file (``cp ../apexpy/igrf13coeff.txt``) into the
   current directory.
6. Execute the ``apextest`` binary to generate the new ``apexsh.dat`` file.
7. Copy the new ``apexsh.dat`` file to the ``apexpy/src/apexpy`` directory.

After updating the ``apexsh.dat`` file, some of the unit tests and the
documentation examples in the README and ``apexpy/docs/examples`` directory
will need to be updated as well.

Modifying Fortran Source
------------------------
When modifying the fortran source code, it can be helpful to run a preliminary
validation of the fortran output independent of the python wrapper.

1. Remove any existing binaries by running the ``make clean`` command.
2. Build the ``apextest`` binary by running the ``make`` command.
3. Copy the IGRF coefficient file (``cp ../apexpy/igrf13coeff.txt``) into the
   current directory.
4. Execute the ``apextext`` binary.
5. Confirm the output printed to the screen matches the test output shown in
   the comment blot at the bottom of ``checkapexsh.f90``.

The output may not match the test output exactly due to floating point errors
and improvements in the precision of the calculation.

After updating the fortran source code, the signature file must be recreated so
the python wrapper works correctly.  It is also a good idea to update
``apexsh.dat`` following the instructions above.  Use `f2py <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/>`_
to create a new signature file from the ``apexpy/src/fortranapex`` directory.
::

  f2py -m fortranapex apexsh.f90 igrf.f90 apex.f90 magfld.f90 makeapexsh.f90 -h fortranapex.pyf --overwrite-signature


This will create the file ``fortranapex.pyf``.  Then reinstall the package with
``pip`` from the root directory.  If the modifications involved adding or
removing fortran source files, modify the list of extension sources in
``setup.py``.

Updating tests and style standards
-----------------------------------

apexpy is in the process of updating unit and integration tests to reduce code
duplication and implementing cleaner style standards. Additionally, some parts
of the fortran code adhere to older coding standards and raise warnings when
compiled with newer compilers. If you would like to assist in these efforts
(help would be appreciated), please discuss your potential contribution with
the current maintainer to ensure a minimal duplication of effort.
