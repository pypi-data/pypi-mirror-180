Reasons for existence
---------------------

I created PyDrumScore primarily for myself. As a drummer, drum teacher, and programmer, I found myself longing for a simple tool to score drums quickly and efficiently.
Modern scoring software is incredibly powerful, but for drums, it can sometimes be **too powerful**. Driven by the need to allow for complex orchestrations with multiple instruments, these tools have developed extensive interfaces that can have a steep learning curve.
Tackling this learning curve is worth it for composers who need the full extent of those features, but for drums it can feel like overkill. In addition, I have personally felt that drums tend to be "tacked on" to most scoring tools.
With drums relegated to an afterthought, the inherent complexity of the software leaks into the beautiful simplicity of our instrument. ðŸ¥²

I am keenly aware that the Venn diagram of people who are both avid drummers and interested in Python programming is far from a perfect circle.

Core technical philosophies
---------------------------

The use, as much as possible, of Python's **core features**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This helps to preserve simplicity and allows people already familiar with Python syntax to get started with only a minimal API to learn. Conjointly, it can serve

Doing one thing, and one thing well
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
