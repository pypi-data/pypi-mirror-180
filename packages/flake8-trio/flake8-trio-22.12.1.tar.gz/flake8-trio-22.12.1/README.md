# flake8-trio

A highly opinionated flake8 plugin for Trio-related problems.

This can include anything from outright bugs, to pointless/dead code,
to likely performance issues, to minor points of idiom that might signal
a misunderstanding.

It may well be too noisy for anyone with different opinions, that's OK.

Pairs well with flake8-async and flake8-bugbear.

## Installation

```console
pip install flake8-trio
```

## List of warnings

- **TRIO100**: a `with trio.fail_after(...):` or `with trio.move_on_after(...):`
  context does not contain any `await` statements.  This makes it pointless, as
  the timeout can only be triggered by a checkpoint.
- **TRIO101**: `yield` inside a nursery or cancel scope is only safe when implementing a context manager - otherwise, it breaks exception handling.
- **TRIO102**: it's unsafe to await inside `finally:` or `except BaseException/trio.Cancelled` unless you use a shielded
  cancel scope with a timeout.
- **TRIO103**: `except BaseException` and `except trio.Cancelled` with a code path that doesn't re-raise.
- **TRIO104**: `Cancelled` and `BaseException` must be re-raised - when a user tries to `return` or `raise` a different exception.
- **TRIO105**: Calling a trio async function without immediately `await`ing it.
- **TRIO106**: trio must be imported with `import trio` for the linter to work.
- **TRIO107**: exit or `return` from async function with no guaranteed checkpoint or exception since function definition.
- **TRIO108**: exit, yield or return from async iterable with no guaranteed checkpoint since possible function entry (yield or function definition)
  Checkpoints are `await`, `async for`, and `async with` (on one of enter/exit).
- **TRIO109**: Async function definition with a `timeout` parameter - use `trio.[fail/move_on]_[after/at]` instead
- **TRIO110**: `while <condition>: await trio.sleep()` should be replaced by a `trio.Event`.
- **TRIO111**: Variable, from context manager opened inside nursery, passed to `start[_soon]` might be invalidly accesed while in use, due to context manager closing before the nursery. This is usually a bug, and nurseries should generally be the inner-most context manager.
- **TRIO112**: nursery body with only a call to `nursery.start[_soon]` and not passing itself as a parameter can be replaced with a regular function call.
- **TRIO113**: using `nursery.start_soon` in `__aenter__` doesn't wait for the task to begin. Consider replacing with `nursery.start`.
- **TRIO114**: Startable function (i.e. has a `task_status` parameter) not in `--startable-in-context-manager` parameter list, please add it so TRIO113 can catch errors when using it.
- **TRIO115**: Replace `trio.sleep(0)` with the more suggestive `trio.lowlevel.checkpoint()`.
- **TRIO116**: `trio.sleep()` with >24 hour interval should usually be`trio.sleep_forever()`.


## Configuration
[You can configure `flake8` with command-line options](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html),
but we prefer using a config file.

### `no-checkpoint-warning-decorators`
Specify a list of decorators to disable checkpointing checks for, turning off TRIO107 and TRIO108 warnings for functions decorated with any decorator matching any in the list. Matching is done with [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html). Defaults to disabling for `asynccontextmanager`.

Decorators-to-match must be identifiers or dotted names only (not PEP-614 expressions), and will match against the name only - e.g. `foo.bar` matches `foo.bar`, `foo.bar()`, and `foo.bar(args, here)`, etc.

For example:
```
[flake8]
no-checkpoint-warning-decorators =
  mydecorator,
  mydecoratorpackage.checkpointing_decorators.*,
  ign*,
  *.ignore,
```


### `startable-in-context-manager`
Comma-separated list of methods which should be used with `.start()` when opening a context manager,
in addition to the default `trio.run_process`, `trio.serve_tcp`, `trio.serve_ssl_over_tcp`, and
`trio.serve_listeners`.  Names must be valid identifiers as per `str.isidentifier()`. For example:
```
[flake8]
startable-methods-in-context-manager =
  myfun,
  myfun2,
```
