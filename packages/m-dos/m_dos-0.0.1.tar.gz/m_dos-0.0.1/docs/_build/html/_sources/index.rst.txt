Welcome to Dos's documentation!
===============================

This package was made as a project in the software devlopment course.
The main goal here is to predict the three sources of energier (electric consumption, Gaz and Nuclear) at France country-wise scale. And also providing an interactive map of France at the city-wise level displaying the yearly average household electricity consumption between 2018 and 2021.
And because we mainly learn with examples, detailled explanations of the objects and their construction are presented in the gallery.
