A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
Indeed, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn-out.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
And that's not all.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
The same applied to Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early.
Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not?
Enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests.
Take the test or not?
We asked two specialists for their opinion.
African-American men are also more at risk.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
Therefore I recommend taking the test.
Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Some are also completely unexplained.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for a number of others.
This massively damages people's health.
Weight
Diet
Vitamins
For the time being however their research is inconclusive.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson revealed
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
Based on this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner we have good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
More stable field
In fact not all particles, or all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
