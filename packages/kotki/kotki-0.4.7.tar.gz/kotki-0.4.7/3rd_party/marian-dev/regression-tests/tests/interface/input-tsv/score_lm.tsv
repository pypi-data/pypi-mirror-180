hop@@ s are not a typical enough example for us to understand the importance of the common agricultural policy for farmers in the European Union .
they do , however , show the extent to which it actually helps our farmers .
as Mr May@@ er said , hop@@ s are a traditional product which is particularly important to the quality of beer produced , although production is very limited ; some 4 000 hec@@ tar@@ es of land throughout the whole of Europe .
yet a sufficient number of farming families in the countries where hop@@ s are produced , particularly in Ba@@ vari@@ a , make their living from that product alone .
these families should not be left to the mercy of continual price falls , neither should they be forced to desert specific rural areas because of difficulties arising from ir@@ regul@@ arities within the market .
there have been a number of changes to the main regulation relating to this particular product as a result of the market fluctu@@ ations and the changing needs of farmers , the most recent being the Council decision to set a uniform level of aid to producers for a period of five years .
this latest decision al@@ ters the obligations of the Commission arising from the previous regime , that is of having to grant annual aid , and Members States no longer need to grant aid for setting up production teams .
this development means that certain articles of the old regulation need to be re@@ vo@@ ked which , rightly so , is carried out in the new regulation for which we will be voting , together with Mr May@@ er &apos;s amend@@ ments , noting that the proposed regulation will not in any way affect the budget .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapp@@ or@@ te@@ ur on the report . I can inform you that the Group of the European Liberal , Demo@@ crat and Reform Party will support the report when it is put to the vote .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I first of all want to thank the rapp@@ or@@ te@@ ur , Mr Xa@@ ver May@@ er , for a valuable report - and perhaps especially for his enthusiastic presentation of the hop paradise of Ba@@ vari@@ a - together with the Committee on Agriculture and R@@ ural Development for its constructive attitude .
