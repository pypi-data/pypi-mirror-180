That concludes , ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has come to the end of the agenda.
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted to plenary at the beginning of the next part-session.
Mr Manders has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you, the Bureau and all my fellow Members well for the new year.

Indeed, I would even like to say that if they are not present, the Commission and the Council should be named.


I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
