A republican strategy to counteract the re-election of Obama.
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brean Center's latter is in favour of a myth, confirming that electoral fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the crack.
In fact, the lawyers of the Republicans have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years' time.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US federal states are responsible for holding the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009, which make the procedure for registration or the ballot process more difficult.
This phenomenon has become more relevant after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new republican representatives being recorded in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a light-turn and evidence of US citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also shorten the periods of early vote, which declares the right to be invalid to register as voters on election day, and citizens are denied the right to vote for which a court is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State asked the electorate to show a light-turn.
Indiana was the first federal state to make such a request.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, in 34 federal states, they have been calling for legislative proposals to force the electorate to show a light-turn.
It is important to note that US citizens do not have a universal card as the Health Insurance Card, as opposed to ouebec.
In fact, 11 per cent of US citizens, i.e. 21 million residents, do not have an identity card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million newly in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to obtain the necessary cards.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of the Afro-Americaner, 15 per cent of people with an income of less than .35.000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years and 20 per cent of the voters between 18 and 29 do not have the necessary identity card.
That goes even further.
Students who are regarded as voters who are increasing their voices more for democratic candidates is not permitted in several states to use their identity card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of Angel or hunting to choose the republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no federal state called for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first federal state to make such a request.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the impanish voices.
It is clear that two out of three-panic voters favour the democratic party.
In addition, republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight federal states with which the registration of voters at the polling day was abolished.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, the campaigns on electoral registration have helped to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of the registration of newly-lappers in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, the general elections in Florida in 2008 in Florida were 33r of the voters elected in advance, Afro-Americane, even though they make up only 13 per cent of the electorate of the federal state.
The same applies to the Chinese people.
The latter only accounted for 11 per cent of the voters, but 24 per cent of the citizens elected in advance.
Contrary to that, the Belarusians, which represented 76 per cent of the voters, only accounted for 46 per cent of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The Advocate-General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial legislation.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have adopted laws that require the signs of a light-saving card.
However, the newly established rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise electoral law in 2012.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the laws adopted and see them as a clear objective to influence the results in the Member States that are crucial for 2012.
A report by the Brunnan Ceners of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the ballot box to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
