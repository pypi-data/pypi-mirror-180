I would be delighted if it were also intended for people who need it, such as pensioners.
Mr President, very briefly on the texts adopted yesterday.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
Mrs Reding has mentioned this.
Could you please correct that?
Mrs Lulling, I cannot correct that because this report does not concern you at all.
As you rightly said, on 16 September, you were elected, and this report backs the state of 13 June.
They replaced Mrs Reding.
There will therefore be another report which, I hope, will confirm your mandate.
Mr President, because it is Christmas, I would like you to give me time!
I would like to thank you and clarify a misunderstanding.
The President has the right to put a question to the Commission.
That concludes the agenda, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr Manders has the floor for a point of order.
I would even like to allow me to name the Commission and the Council, even if they are not present.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
