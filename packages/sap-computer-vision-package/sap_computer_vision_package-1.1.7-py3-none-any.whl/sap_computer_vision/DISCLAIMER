When you build the template Docker images then a third party base image and several additional open source components are loaded.
Please refer to the license of the PyTorch base image at the bottom of their homepage (https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch).
As with all Docker images, this likely also contains other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution,
along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).
The list of the additional open source components can be found in the requirements.txt file in the package.
Please refer to the individual documentation of these components for more details on the licenses.
When using pretrained models the weights are loaded either from detectron2 (https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
or timms (https://rwightman.github.io/pytorch-image-models/), where you can find more information on their licenses.

Note that you are responsible for checking and accepting the license terms for all above mentioned third party components as part of the build and training process.
