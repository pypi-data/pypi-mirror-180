# climatereport_zillow

Unlike other real estate sites, Zillow listings do not contain a section on the environmental risk of the property in the listing. This package takes a Zillow url as input and uses it to compile a report on the climate risks of the property in the zillow listing. 

## Installation

$ pip install climatereport_zillow
