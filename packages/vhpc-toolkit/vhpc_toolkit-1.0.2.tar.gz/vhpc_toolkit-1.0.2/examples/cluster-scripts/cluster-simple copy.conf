# Virtualized High Performance Computing Toolkit
# Example of creating 2 VMs and execute post scripts after VM provision
# "barrier" key enforces the order of script execution -
# hello-world2.sh will only be executed on vhpc_vm02 after hello-world1.sh executed on VM vhpc_vm01
# this function will be useful if there are any software dependencies for different VMs when provisioning a cluster
# Modify the file according to your platform and needs
