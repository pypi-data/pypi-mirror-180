# mixer09122022


`mixer2` is the version that works. 

`mixer3` is for refactoring attempts.

## mixer2

`test_many.py` is whether the program lives.

it inputs `de_chua_tron_091122.html` and output N (4) tests `de_da_tron_{id}.html` with all the answers written in `cau_tra_loi.docx`

## notes


-    libre to save docx as html (not export) (to preserve all the images of equations and subscripts)
-    python to mix and output the tests (in html) with its answers (`docx`)
-    libre writer to save html as docx, then export to pdf to preserve all the images
- input needs to be formatted in a particular way (as in `de_chua_tron_091122.docx`

## code logic

- input `html` and read into a `BeautifulSoup` document
- get the questions into an array. `shuffle` the array N times
- traverse the question array with a `for` loop: process the question along the way (add bold title, pack images, shuffle answers)
- output to 4 `html` files, output the answers to one file (with timestamp and testID)

## further consideration
 questions with answers are tabulated or not. and are html tags which can be stored in a database for further web app development.
