- Crosshairs
- Reduce the usages of private methods in Matplotlib

Low
===

- ``annotate``
  (Adequate manipulations for ``xycoords`` and ``textcoords`` are required,
  which is tough for my current time schedule.)
- Isoproportion lines
- ``errorbar``
  (Implementation of error bars along ternary axes?
  The error bars in ternary plots for different axes may be correlated with
  each other.)
- More general (hexagonal) plotting of a part of the triangle
- Parallelogram plots
- Piper diagram
- Triangular and hexagonal binning with values (like `ggtern <http://www.ggtern.com/2017/07/23/version-2-2-1-released/>`_)
- Tie lines
- Log scale
- Scatter Hist (ternary-plot version of `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/gallery/axes_grid1/scatter_hist_locatable_axes.html>`_)
