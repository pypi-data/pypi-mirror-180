# PhyNetPy

PhyNetPy is a Python Library that implements all the capabilities of PhyloNet, but with higher performance algorithms that are built to be more efficient and scalable.
An official stable release date cannot yet be provided, but any first release will include some basic network inference methods.

To install PhyNetPy, simply open up a command line instance and execute the following:
`pip install phynetpy`. 

A tutorial and further instructions on how to use PhyNetPy will be made available on our website, https://phylogenomics.rice.edu
