## Appscan Version Requirements

Your version of Appscan should be able to support the requisite API calls made by the library. This library is tested with Appscan v9.8.0+, however it is compatible with lower versions (though ymmv).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.5 or higher
- requests
- beautifulsoup4

Can be installed with:

```shell
pip install --user pyappscan
```

## How to Use

Use this module by importing the class first, then calling the method you would like to use. It is initiazized with the url to the appscan api, followed by the username, password, featurekey, and ssl cert path (for more information on the feature key, please look at the appscan api docs, which give different options. The default is `AppscanEnterpriseUser`). Usage:

```python
from pyappscan import create_engine
myClass = create_engine(
  'https://route-to-appscan-api.com:443/ase/api',
  username='user',
  password='pass',
  key='AppscanEnterpriseUser',
  verify='/var/www/mycerts/appscancert.crt'
)

# We can also use an API key to login
myClass = create_engine(
  'https://route-to-appscan-api.com:443/ase/api',
  apikey="ac6719683d871e173961ff",
  secretkey="secret-key",
  verify='/var/www/mycerts/appscancert.crt'
)
```
