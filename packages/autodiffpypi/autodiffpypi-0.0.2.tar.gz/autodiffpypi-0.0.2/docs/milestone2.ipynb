    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Differentiation allows for fast and precise derivitative computation. It is not, however, the only method for computing derivatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives are a fundamental tool in mathematics with applications in a range of scientific fields.  Differentiation is core to many computational problems including finding extrema and zeroes of functions. Optimization problems such as gradient descent in neural networks depend on partial derivatives to incrementally move towards optimal solutions. Directional derivatives and the Jacobian matrix are utilized in a variety of contexts including backpropogation in training neural networks. Directional derivatives compute the change in a mult-dimensional function with a respect to any linear combination of its input parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the prevalence of derivatives in computational fields, automatic differentiation focuses on developing algorithmic techniques for efficiently evaluating derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbolic differentiation\n",
    "Symbolic differentiation applies basic derivative rules to compute derivatives at the expression level. While precise, symbolic differentiation uses excess computational power and memory to hold the swelling equation resulting from chain rule. Symbolic differentiation computes the derivative of a function analytically, which offers high precision at the cost of execution time and exponential size in relation to the original function. Since many science applications care about the derivative evaluated at a value, we can often bypass the need for an analytic form for the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite difference method\n",
    "The finite difference method, on the other hand, estimates the derivative by computing the slope of the secant line, using a small change in $x$. The precision of the derivative depends on the choice of $x$; too large of a step leads to precision error but too small of a step creates rounding error.  Numerical differentiation, on the other hand, offers O(n) time computation for an n-dimensional gradient (think multi-dimensional derivative). It achieves this by estimating the derivative instead of computing it precisely. The trade-off, as with all estimations, is a reduction in accuracy due to rounding and truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AutoDiff?\n",
    "Automatic Differentiation achieves the precision of symbolic differentiation with time complexity that matches the complexity of computing the original function. It does this by leveraging a useful fact: when computing a derivative at a specific point, we don't need the symbolic expression of the derivative. This allows us to compute our derivative via a series of computations that compute each depending on the prior computation rather than deriving the entire expression and plugging in the point at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In forward mode, the graph can be abstract as computations are made on-the-fly and no storage of all prior computations is needed. In reverse-mode, on the other hand, space needs will exceed those of computing the original function as the computational graphs of derivatives will need to be stored and computed in reverse."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomatic differentiation (AD) is based on the property of decomposition of a function into intermediate steps based on the chain rule: $$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
    "Consider the function $f(x_1, x_2) = e^{-(\\sin(x_1) + \\cos(x_2)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1q8eWiv6gv-ty2rv-S0OuEOqwmeVhsLgq)\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative is derived by chaining together the product of the outer derivative with each of the inner derivatives. This creates a computational graph, where each edge represents an elementary operation applied to an intermediary node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode AD uses forward accumulation of these intermediary steps, traversing the chain rule in a partial ordering from the most inner part (the original inputs) working outward until the entire derivative has been evaluated. In addition, at each step we compute the derivative of the intermediate variables, called the tangent trace. This allows for us to compute the directional derivative in a single pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dual numbers are convenient for differentiation since can allow us to capture both the primal and tangent trace at the same time. A dual number can be expressed as $a + b\\epsilon$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $\\epsilon$ is small enough such that $\\epsilon^2 = 0$. The real part stores the primal trace while the dual part stores the tangent trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode automatic differentiation takes a seed vector which determines the direction of the derivative. This can be any linear combination of derivatives. To compute the full Jacobian using Forward Mode AD, this requires performing $m$ passes where $m$ is the number of inputs to the original function. On each pass, we calculate the derivative with respect to that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Reverse mode AD enables us to compute the full gradient in two passes. This requires storing an explicit computational graph. In the forward pass, reverse mode computes the primal trace and partial derivatives with respect to the parent node. In the reverse pass, these are reconstructed via the chain rule by accumulating the values of all child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime of Forward and Reverse modes -\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is defined as $ \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m $, Forward Mode computes the gradient with respect to the number of independent variables.\n",
    "Therefore, the computational cost of using Forward Mode depends on the number of independent variables n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Mode computes the gradient with respect to the number of outputs. Therefore, the computational cost of using Forward Mode depends on the number of outputs, m.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, if there are more outputs than inputs, Forward mode is more efficient.\n",
    "On the other hand, if there are more inputs than outputs, Reverse mode is more efficient."

    "This section provides a more rigorous explanation of the technical design and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Motivation: the Base Derivatives class will hold direct computations of primitive derivatives such as logarithmic, exponential, trig, and logistic functions. This will allow us to directly compute derivatives at each stage of the pass. \n",
    "* Arguments: each method will take in a function $f$ and output $f'$\n",

    "* Methods: This class will have methods that override the Dunder methods of `__add__`, `__pow__`, `__mul__`, `__radd__`, `__rmul__`, `__truediv__`, `__repr__`. This operator overriding will ensure that basic mathematical operations work on Dual Numbers as well as combining them with ints and floats. Critical for the Dunder methods is that they return new Dual Numbers such that they don't return one of the inputs.\n",

    "#### Override Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Motivation: we need to be able to perform basic mathematical computations such as trig functions, exponentials, logarithmic, and logistic using Dual Numbers.\n",
    "* Arguments: Each function will take as an argument the expression (can be a Dual Number or real number) and output the value after passing the argument through the function.\n",
    "* Methods: This file will include independent methods such as: `sin(arg)`, `cos(arg)`, `exp(arg)`, `log_base(arg,base)`. These functions will operate on both Dual Numbers, capturing the Dual component as needed, and real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "* Motivation: the Forward-Mode class runs Forward-Mode AD on a function $f$.\n",
    "* Arguments: the class takes a function `f` in its `__init__` method.\n",
    "* Methods:\n",
    "  * compute_derivative accepts an input variable and evaluates the derivative of $f$ at the variable.\n",
    "  * compute_jacobian computes the Jacobian via computing the derivative on all the input variables.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reverse \n",
    "\n",
    "* Motivation: the Reverse-Mode class runs Reverse-Mode AD on a function $f$. \n",
    "* Arguments: the Reverse-Mode class when initialized will accept a function $f$ and a computational graph comprising Nodes.\n",
    "* Methods: the Reverse-Mode class will have $sort$, get_derivative, get_jacobian, and backward_pass methods. More on these methods in M2: extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node\n",
    "\n",
    "* Motivation: the Node module will hold the Node class that forms the computational graph needed for Reverse-Mode AD. \n",
    "* Node:\n",
    "  * Arguments: the Node will be initialized with two arguments: a value and a local gradient. It will also hold an array of child nodes to form the graph.\n",

    "Now that you've got most of the hard implementation work done, what kinds of things do you want to implement next?\n",
    "- We plan to implement Reverse Mode AD next\n",
    "\n",
    "How will your software change?\n",
    "- Our software organization will not change because we already had accounted for reverse mode in our milestone 1 documentation. It has a `reverse.py` file in the src directory, and a `graph.py` file in the structures directory which will be the home of the node class used in reverse AD. These are currently outlined in an open pull request and will be fully implemented and tested prior to the final milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will be the primary challenges to implementing these new features?\n",
    "- Reverse mode will introduce greater data structure requirements than forward mode. Dual numbers are not very useful in reverse mode since we don't apply the chain rule directly -- reverse mode computes the sensitivity of f with respect to the independent *and* intermediate variables. This means creating a new data structure we can traverse, and use basic operations on, hence the Node class.\n",
    "- Another challenge is that in our design of this node class, we have to efficiently store and traverse the full computational graph! Even though there are fewer mathematical operations, there is more memory necessary for reverse mode than for foward mode, and we need to make this traversal efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Extensions\n",
    "We are planning to expand our project in a few further ways:\n",
    "1. Adding support for multiple functions of multiple inputs\n",
    "- Note that our Milestone 2 code only works for scalar functions of a single input\n",
    "- Our software will change because we need to be able to take partial derivatives. In our current application, the dual part of the dual number acts as the derivative at a given step, but it does not handle taking, say, the derivative of x + y only with respect to y.\n",
    "- This presents challenges because it poses the question of how we should adapt our current dual numbers class to handle partial derivatives.\n",
    "- Our software will use `numpy` to handle higher-dimensional functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Writing a sample application using AutoDiffPy functionalities\n",
    "- The autodifferentiation capabilities can be used for Newton's method or implementing a simple neural network.\n",
    "- This brings challenges because it is fairly separate than our current work, so it will take a lot of research to efficiently create these sample applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Making our software installable via PyPI\n",
    "- The current project code can be installed and set up per the \"Installation\" section, which involves a `requirements.txt` file. In the next iteration, it will be distributed via PyPI."

    "## Broader Impact\n",
    "Our software provides a tool for users to efficiently compute derivatives and jacobian values. As a public package lisenced under the MIT License, this tool may be used in a number of areas ranging from scientific research, personal projects, and industry applications. While our package provides similar functionality to pre-existing AutoDiff software, releasing our own version still contributes to the public domain by providing a unique implementation and framework that others may find particularly suitable to their use case. \n",

    "As the authors of this package, there are a few consequences important to note. Firstly, while our library has undergone unit and integration testing, we cannot guarantee full correctness in all cases, especially under the conditions of large-scale usage. As with most software, this package may be subject to further iteration & fixes. There may be significant consequences if this AutoDiff library is used without user-written tests; therefore we expect any users to take responsibility for ensuring that their applications meet their expectations and that integrating this AutoDiff package does not make them susceptible to incorrect or unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Inclusivity\n",
    "The aim of this package is to increase access to Autodifferentiation capabilities, for students, researchers, programmers, and others who find it applicable. Additionally, our code is released on Github to improve visibility of the internal implementation of such libraries. We welcome open-source contributions or suggestions, which can be submitted by forking this repository and creating a pull-request (this pull request can contain a simple txt file for suggestions). Pull requests will be reviewed and approved by the original authors, who may reach out to you for collaboration. As an international team, we are happy to work with individuals of any background including non-native English speakers, and will provide language accomodation if needed.
