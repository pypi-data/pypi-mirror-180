# pyFDEMvisualizer - An FDEM Visualiser Post-Processing Package
### University of Toronto, 2022

This Python package performs transformations on FDEM models in vtk/vtu format. 
Functions calculated include:
- Extract information within the FDEM Model based on the name of the array (e.g., Stress, Strain, Temperature, etc...) Works in 2D and 3D.
- Extract stress-strain information for UCS and BD Simulations (Works in 2D and 3D). Optional addition of virtual strain gauges (Limited to 2D).
- Plotting stress vs strain curve.
- Calculate the Elastic Modulus of the dataset. Eavg, Esec and Etan can be evaluated. Works in 2D and 3D.
- Extract information of a particular cell based on a sequence of array names. This can be extended to extracting information along a line. Works in 2D and 3D.
- Extract information of a threshold dataset criteria based on a sequence of array names. Works in 2D and 3D.
- Extract mesh information and plot rosette/polar plots. Limited to 2D.
- Automatic detection/ User-defined assigment of loading direction when analysing mechanical simulations, namely UCS, BD, and PLT, in both 2D and 3D simulations.

## How to use it - Termimal
1. After installation is complete, in a terminal/cmd session where you keep your Python projects, type the following command:
    ```python
    python
    ```
2. In terminal, import fdem-visualizer module like so: 
    ```python
    import pyFDEMvisualizer as fd
    ```
3. Specify the path to folder where your models (.vtk, .vtu files) are located on your machine.
    ```python
    model = fd.Model("abs_model_path_on_machine")
    ```
4. You are ready to start using openfdem! See the operating module for full description of functions available.

## Example OpenFDEM Functions
1. Getting number of points in your model:
    ```python
    model.n_points
    ```
   Output:
   ```python
   11904
   ```

2. Getting the stress-strain for platen:
   ```python
       model.complete_stress_strain(progress_bar=True)
   ```
   Output:
   ```python
       >>>Script Identifying Platen
       >>>Platen Material ID found as [1]
       >>>Progress: |//////////////////////////////////////////////////| 100.0% Complete
       >>>1.51 seconds
