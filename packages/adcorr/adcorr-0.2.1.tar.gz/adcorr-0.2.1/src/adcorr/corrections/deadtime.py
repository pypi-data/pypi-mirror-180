    Correct for detector deadtime by iteratively solving for the number of incident

    detector characteristics, as detailed in section 3.3.4 of 'Everything SAXS: small-
    angle scattering pattern collection and correction'

        frames: A stack of frames to be corrected.
        count_times: The period over which photons are counted for each frame.
        minimum_pulse_separation: The minimum time difference required between a prior
            pulse and the current pulse for the current pulse to be recorded correctly.
        minimum_arrival_separation: The minimum time difference required between the
            current pulse and a subsequent pulse for the current pulse to be recorded
