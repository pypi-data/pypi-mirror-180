    The `start` field of `Position` represents the place of the first character
    of the parsed source region. The `end` field of Position represents the place
    of the first character after the parsed source region, whether it exists or not.
    The value of the `start` and `end` fields implement the `Point` interface.

    (plus start line) in the source region, for elements that span multiple lines.

    the time of parsing, the node is said to be `generated` and it must not have positional
