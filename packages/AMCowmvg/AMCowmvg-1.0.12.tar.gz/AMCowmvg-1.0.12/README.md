# AMC-OWMVG
## Antimony Model Creator - Olivia Walsh, Matthew Van Ginneken

This package allows the user to visualize a reaction via a steady state graph.  The user can create and submit their own reactions on the Flask Webpage, or they can submit an antimony txt file or a SBML file also through the webpage.
