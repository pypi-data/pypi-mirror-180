        ===============
        
        Python module which converts a Chinese sentence from Simplified/Traditional to Mandarin/Pinyin and Traditional/Simplified to Cantonese/Jyutping, outputting diacritics (accented characters). I designed this library to create Mandarin and Cantonese flashcards.
