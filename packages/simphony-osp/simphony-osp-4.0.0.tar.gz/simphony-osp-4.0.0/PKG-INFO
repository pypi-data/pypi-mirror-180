# SimPhoNy

The SimPhoNy Open Simulation Platform is a framework that aims to achieve
interoperability between software such as simulation engines, databases and
data repositories using a knowledge graph as the common language. It is focused
on the domain of materials science.

SimPhoNy enables:
- Visualization and exploration of
  [OWL ontologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/) and
  [RDFS Vocabularies](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)
- _Wrappers_: interfaces between ontologies and software products or digital
  objects
- Manipulation of ontology-based data: work with ontology individuals,
  transfer them among different software products using the wrappers, and query
  the knowledge graph

## Installation

SimPhoNy is available on PyPI, so it can be installed using pip

`pip install simphony-osp`

Detailed installation instructions can be found
[here](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/introduction/installation.html).
