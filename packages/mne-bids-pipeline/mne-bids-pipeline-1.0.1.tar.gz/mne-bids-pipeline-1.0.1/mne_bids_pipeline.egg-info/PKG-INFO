# MNE-BIDS-Pipeline

The MNE-BIDS-Pipeline is a full-flegded processing pipeline for your MEG and
EEG data. It operates on data stored according to the Brain Imaging Data
Structure (BIDS).

# Documentation

Please find the installation and usage instructions at
[mne.tools/mne-bids-pipeline](https://mne.tools/mne-bids-pipeline).

# Acknowledgments

The original pipeline for MEG/EEG data processing with MNE python was built
jointly by the [Cognition and Brain Dynamics Team](https://brainthemind.com/)
and the [MNE Python Team](https://mne.tools), based on scripts originally
developed for this publication:

> A. Gramfort (2018). A reproducible MEG/EEG group study with the MNE software:
> recommendations, quality assessments, and good practices. Frontiers in
> neuroscience, 12. https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00530

The current iteration is based on BIDS and relies on the extensions to BIDS
for EEG and MEG. See the following two references:
