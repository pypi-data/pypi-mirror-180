pyobjcryst
==========

Python bindings to ObjCryst++, the Object-Oriented Crystallographic Library.

The documentation for this release of pyobjcryst can be found on-line at
http://diffpy.github.io/pyobjcryst.


INSTALLATION
------------
pyobjcryst is available for Python 3.7 (deprecated), and 3.8 to 3.11.

Note regarding windows: on conda-forge, pyobjcryst 2.2.3 is available
for python3.7 only, and version 2.2.4 is available for python 3.8 and
3.9 using a `pypy` environment rather than the regular cpython interpreter.

Using conda (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend to use `Anaconda Python <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_
as it allows to install all software dependencies together with
pyobjcryst. For other Python distributions it is necessary to
install the required software separately. 

Using conda, we recommend installing pyobjcryst using the "conda-forge" channel ::

   conda install -c conda-forge pyobjcryst

Note: when updating, please make sure you are upgrading both
libobjcryst and pyobjcryst packages.

You can also install from the "diffpy" channel - especially if you use
pyobjcryst allong with the other diffpy tools for PDF calculations,
but it is not updated as often as conda-forge.

pyobjcryst is also included in the "diffpy-cmi" collection
of packages for structure analysis ::

   conda install -c diffpy diffpy-cmi

From source
^^^^^^^^^^^
The requirements are:

* ``libobjcryst`` - Object-Oriented Crystallographic Library for C++,
  https://github.com/diffpy/libobjcryst
* ``setuptools``  - tools for installing Python packages
* ``NumPy`` - library for scientific computing with Python
* ``python-dev`` - header files for interfacing Python with C
* ``libboost-all-dev`` - Boost C++ libraries and development files
* ``scons`` - software construction tool (optional)

The above requirements are easily installed through conda using e.g.::

  conda install numpy compilers boost scons libobjcryst

Alternatively, on Ubuntu Linux the required software can be installed using::

   sudo apt-get install \
      python-setuptools python-numpy scons \
      build-essential python-dev libboost-all-dev


The libobjcryst library can also be installed as per the instructions at
https://github.com/diffpy/libobjcryst. Make sure other required
software are also in place and then run from the pyobjcryst directory::

   pip install .

You may need to use ``sudo`` with system Python so the process is
allowed to copy files to system directories, unless you are installing
into a conda environment.  If administrator (root)
access is not available, see the usage information from
``python setup.py install --help`` for options to install to
a user-writable location.  The installation integrity can be
verified by executing the included tests with ::

   python -m pyobjcryst.tests.run

An alternative way of installing pyobjcryst is to use the SCons tool,
which can speed up the process by compiling C++ files in several
parallel jobs (-j4)::

   scons -j4 install

See ``scons -h`` for description of build targets and options.

Optional graphical dependencies for jupyter notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some of the classes can produce graphical outputs, which can be
displayed in a jupyter notebook:

* a Crystal structure can be displayed in 3D: this requires the
  ``py3dmol`` and ``ipywidgets`` modules. See the notebook
  ``examples/cystal_3d_widget.ipynb``
* a PowderPattern can be displayed (and live-updated) if
  ``matplotlib`` (and optionnally ``ipympl``) are installed. See the
  notebook ``examples/cimetidine-structure-solution-powder.ipynb``

In short, ``pip install jupyter matplotlib ipywidgets py3dmol``
will give you all the required dependencies. Note that you can also
use this in jupyterlab.

Note that ``jupyter``, ``ipywidgets``, ``matplotlib`` and ``ipympl`` can
be installed using conda(-forge), but ``py3dmol`` should be installed using
``pip``, as the conda version is obsolete.


DEVELOPMENT
-----------

pyobjcryst is an open-source software originally developed as a part of the
DiffPy-CMI complex modeling initiative at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory, and is also further developed at ESRF.
The pyobjcryst sources are hosted at
https://github.com/diffpy/pyobjcryst.

Feel free to fork the project and contribute.  To install pyobjcryst
in a development mode, where its sources are directly used by Python
rather than copied to a system directory, use ::

   python setup.py develop --user

When developing it is preferable to compile the C++ files with
SCons using the ``build=develop`` option, which compiles the extension
module with debug information and C-assertions checks ::

   scons -j4 build=debug develop

The build script checks for a presence of ``sconsvars.py`` file, which
can be used to permanently set the ``build`` variable.  The SCons
construction environment can be further customized in a ``sconscript.local``
script.  The package integrity can be verified by executing unit tests with
``scons -j4 test``.

When developing with Anaconda Python it is essential to specify
header path, library path and runtime library path for the active
Anaconda environment.  This can be achieved by setting the ``CPATH``,
``LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``LDFLAGS`` environment variables as follows::

   # resolve the prefix directory P of the active Anaconda environment
   P=$CONDA_PREFIX
   export CPATH=$P/include
   export LIBRARY_PATH=$P/lib
   export LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,$P/lib
   # compile and re-install pyobjcryst
   scons -j4 build=debug develop

Note the Anaconda package for the required libobjcryst library is built
with a C++ compiler provided by Anaconda.  This may cause incompatibility
with system C++.  In such case please use Anaconda C++ to build pyobjcryst.

Quick conda environment from libobjcryst and pyobjcryst sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``conda`` is available, you can create a pyobjcryst environment
from the git repositories (downloaded in the current directory) using::

  conda create --yes --name pyobjcryst numpy matplotlib ipywidgets jupyter
  conda install --yes  -n pyobjcryst -c conda-forge boost scons py3dmol
  conda activate pyobjcryst
  git clone https://github.com/diffpy/libobjcryst.git
  cd libobjcryst
  scons -j4 install prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX
  cd ..
  git clone https://github.com/diffpy/pyobjcryst.git
  cd pyobjcryst
  export CPATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/include
  export LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib
  export LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,$CONDA_PREFIX/lib
  scons -j4 install prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX

You can also contact Vincent Favre-Nicolin (favre@esrf.fr) if you
are using pyobjcryst outside diffpy, e.g. to display structures
in a notebook, refine powder patterns or solve structures using the
global optimisation algorithms, etc..
