Usage
-----

When writing a post, you can use any of the following notations to link to microblogging content:

Usernames
~~~~~~~~~

Both Mastodon and Twitter usernames are supported. Any instance of "@username@host.name" will be replaced with a link to the appropriate instances' user account page, and any instance of "@username" will be replaced with a link to the twitter account page for the user.

Twitter statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To link a Twitter status, you write "@username/status/<numeric-tweet-id>"; essentially, you take the Twitter link itself and you replace "https://twitter.com/" with "@"
