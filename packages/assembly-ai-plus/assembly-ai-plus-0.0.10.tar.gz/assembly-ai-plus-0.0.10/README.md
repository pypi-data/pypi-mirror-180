## Install

``` sh
pip install assembly-ai-plus
```

### How it works

``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  User-&gt;&gt;submit_audio_for_transcription: Audio URL or Local file path and include other intelligence features
  submit_audio_for_transcription--&gt;&gt;User: transcription_id
  User-&gt;&gt;get_transcription_results: transcription_id, all_details=True/False
  get_transcription_results--&gt;&gt;User: Full Transcription Results
```

## How to use

This Library provides a
[`AssemblyAI`](https://afizs.github.io/assembly-ai-plus/assemblyai.html#assemblyai)
class using which you can submit audio files for transcribing and
understanding.

``` python
from assembly_ai_plus.assemblyai import AssemblyAI
```

First create the assembly_ai instance by providing the AssemblyAI API
KEY, which you can get it for free from
[here](https://app.assemblyai.com/)

``` python
assembly_ai = AssemblyAI(api_key='YOURKEY')
```

### Submit the audio url for transcription

``` python
res = assembly_ai.submit_audio_for_transcription(audio_url="https://bit.ly/3yxKEIY")
```

``` python
res.get('id') # This id is used to extract the actual text from the audio files.
```

    'rsh0hzmusy-024f-472e-937b-e86223eaf7c9'

### Sumbit Local Audio file for transcription

``` python
res = assembly_ai.submit_audio_for_transcription(local_audio_file_path='your_file_path')
```

``` python
res.get('id')
```

    'rsh0n4g7nv-f022-409b-b97b-9a138261a0d7'

### Getting the Transcription Result

``` python
full_details = assembly_ai.get_transcription_results('rs3c8julbq-177d-4071-ab6f-d7c7a9bb6dbb')
```

``` python
print(full_details['text'])
```
