  skill: deductive logic
  description: Rock paper scissors where you get to chose 2 items but your opponent wins if there is a tie. Present the problem as a sequence of choices, first choose one object, then choose another then oponent choses, without knowing either of your choices -- to try to trick the student into thinking the order matters.
  faqs:
    -  
      S: who wins in rock and scissors vs. paper?
      T: paper, because it's a tie, rock beats scissors scissors beats paper
  variations:
    - Frigate, fighter, drone in video game battle, with deployment and one
    - Add distracting stats/descriptions to increase difficulty/complexity of the problem.
    - 1-on-1 rock paper scissors game as easiest (scoffolding/fallback)
    - 2-on-1 rock paper scissors game as easiy (scoffolding/fallback) 
  hints:
    - generate natural language from logical expression for problem statement
    - generate python code to implement "battle" decider
    - ignore irrelevant information, like the name/size/speed/armor of the elements, the order of deployment, and even the names/descriptions of the scenario
    - reduce problem to logic/code/math by selecting the right variables/details
    - recognize that there is a circular "ranking" of dominant strategies for the standard 1-on-1 game
    - don't forget that drones can beat frigates, even though they are smallest, because of the circular relationship between objects
    - no two objects can be selected that dominate 100% of the time
    - iterate through all the permutations to develop a frequency/likelihood/probability/logic table
    - recognize that the order of your deployment of frigate/fighter/drone doesn't matter

  skill: understand induction vs deduction vs inference
