    Mankind is the black sheep in the universe. It's a dark forest, where the wolves seek and destroy all technological civilizations. In order to escape this doom, the man must save humanity from itself.

    In the end, it came to this: What's the best way to get to the Promised Land, the High-Content Society? Is it by force, by persuasion, or through the natural, pre-intelligent forces of Darwin's marketplace?

    You think you know what to do? You've been thinking about it for a long time, but have yet to take a step forward?

    In that case, you must do as the Athenians did in the 5th century BC, and look to the past for answers.

    There were a few problems with the Athenians' plan:

    This was the time of democratic Athens. The Athenians were always a slightly foolish and blundering people. In truth, the Athenians never liked the idea of revolution in the first place. To them, the only proper way to run a state was to let the people have their say, and then to do as they told you.

    The Athenians also lived on the island of Attica. Attica was just a small part of the Greek world. There were other places that were civilized. There were two

    Humankind is the outcast in the universe. It's a dark forest, where the wolves seek and destroy all technological civilizations. It's a place where life is cheap and brutal, where the only difference between a life and a death is how it's handled. It's a place where humankind is reputed to have been visited by aliens, but no one knows for sure. It's an alien world, an interstellar version of the Wild West, where scientists can travel and explore, and where they're bound to encounter unimaginable horrors. It's this unknown world that I'm writing about.

    Voyage to Pandora

    The birth of Pandora.

    It was a bright, sunny day, and the sun was warm. A baby, a new species, was just born. As soon as it was born, it began to cry. It was just a tiny cry, hardly louder than the cry of a kitten, but it was the first cry of a being born. The infant looked around it, and it saw a world of blue and green and yellow, and it saw a universe of stars. The baby reached out, and it touched the sky. It stretched its hand up towards the sky, and it touched the sky. And it felt a deep, deep connection, and it felt the power of the sky, and it began to cry.

    It was a cry that would

    Thursday, March 25, 2014

    March 25th 2014 and I'm getting ready to turn 30. I don't think it's a good thing to be. I have been pondering this question the last couple of days. I'm in the process of preparing my taxes so I could file them today. I'm also reflecting on my life and what has happened in the last 5 years. And I can honestly say that I have had my fair share of ups and downs.

    I've been on both sides of the spectrum. I've had a job, I've had zero income and I've had none. I've had a house, I've had no house. I've had a bunch of money and I've had nothing. Some of my family and friends think that

    Two Muslims walked into a coffee shop in Manchester, New Hampshire. The owner of the shop, Sharif Ahmed, was arrested for “harassment” when he objected to their presence.

    Soon after Ahmed was arrested, the Islamic Republic of Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on the U.S. military base in Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iraq became the latest Shia-Sunni proxy war. The New Hampshire State House unanimously passed a resolution apologizing to Iran for Ahmed’s arrest.

    Ahmed said that he was trying to help a blind woman when he was arrested.

    Video of the incident shows Ahmed saying that he would not have called the police if it weren’t for the woman who asked him to do so. He then asked the two to please leave, but they refused. Ahmed could be heard pleading with the woman to stop “screaming” in the front of the shop. When she did not, Ahmed pushed her away.

    The police report stated that Ahmed was arrested for “physical abuse” and for “simple assault” because he touched the woman’s elbow.

    But no charges were filed.

    The police report also stated that Ahmed initially said he didn’t know the

    Two Muslims walked into a house to rob it. Unfortunately, the homeowner was a Christian.

    But even more tragically, the Christian woman was killed.

    In her house.

    To be honest, it seems like it should be worse. But in this case, it was worse because the Christian woman was killed. And, as I mentioned in the last installment, it seems like things are going to get much worse for Muslims in the United States.

    I don’t know why this is happening. But I do know why it’s happening. And it’s because Muslims like Dahd Hammad are at the top of the list.

    So, when you get the chance, please support and encourage good Christians to support and encourage good Muslims.

    And when Muslims like Dahd Hammad get the chance, please support and encourage good Christians to support and encourage good Muslims.

    I hope you’re right.

    But if you aren’t, then at least we’ll still have some good people in this world.

    Two Muslims walked into a bar in New Jersey and sat down. The bartender came over and asked them if they wanted any drinks. They said, "No thanks, we're on a diet." The bartender asked them, "Are you on a diet?" and the Muslims answered, "Yes, for the last 40 years."

    That got me thinking about how easy it is to be oppressed by those who are just like us. People are often ready to take part in hating those who are different, but they are not so willing to fight for justice when the oppressor is like them.

    In our scripture readings for today, we learn that Jesus was driven out of the temple because he would not call a Sabbath day a Sabbath day. The Pharisees and the Sadducees were upset that Jesus would not recognize what was expected of him. They were upset that he would not support their religious traditions. They were upset that he would not do what they wanted him to do.

    Jesus was driven out because he was seen as a threat. Jesus was seen as a threat because he wanted to change their religious practices. He was seen as a threat because he was a different kind of religious leader. He was a threat because he was a threat to the status quo. He was
