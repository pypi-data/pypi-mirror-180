    __default__: use
# - next condition: `null` causes the chatbot program to say goodbye and exit
# - `yes`, `y`, `true` creates a default list of affirmative intents
# If only a single next_condition intent string is found, additional intents are inferred:
#    - if there is another list of intents that starts with a single intent string? use that
