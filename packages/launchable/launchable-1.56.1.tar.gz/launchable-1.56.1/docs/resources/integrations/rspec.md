# RSpec

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a reference page. See [Getting started](../../getting-started.md), [Sending data to Launchable](../../sending-data-to-launchable/), and [Subsetting your test runs](../../features/predictive-test-selection/) for more comprehensive usage guidelines.
{% endhint %}

## Recording test results

Use [rspec\_junit\_formatter](https://github.com/sj26/rspec\_junit\_formatter) to output the test results to a file in RSpec. If you already have a CI server storing your test results it may already be installed.

```bash
bundle exec rspec --format RspecJunitFormatter --out report/rspec.xml
```

After running tests, point the CLI to your test report files to collect test results and train the model:

```bash
launchable record tests --build <BUILD NAME> rspec ./report
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
You might need to take extra steps to make sure that `launchable record tests` always runs even if the build fails. See [Always record tests](../../sending-data-to-launchable/ensuring-record-tests-always-runs.md).
{% endhint %}

## Subsetting your test runs

The high level flow for subsetting is:

1. Get the full list of tests/test paths and pass that to `launchable subset` with an optimization target for the subset
2. `launchable subset` will get a subset from the Launchable platform and output that list to a text file
3. Pass the text file into your test runner to run only those tests

To retrieve a subset of tests, first list all the tests you would normally run and pass that to `launchable subset`:

```bash
launchable subset \
  --build <BUILD NAME> \
  --confidence <TARGET> \
  rspec spec/**/*_spec.rb > launchable-subset.txt
```

* The `--build` should use the same `<BUILD NAME>` value that you used before in `launchable record build`.
* The `--confidence` option should be a percentage; we suggest `90%` to start. You can also use `--time` or `--target`; see [Subsetting your test runs](../../features/predictive-test-selection/) for more info.

This creates a file called `launchable-subset.txt` that you can pass into your command to run tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec $(cat launchable-subset.txt) --format d --format RspecJunitFormatter --out rspec.xml
```
