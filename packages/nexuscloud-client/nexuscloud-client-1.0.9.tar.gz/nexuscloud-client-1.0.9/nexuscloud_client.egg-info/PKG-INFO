Nexus Cloud transforms hybrid data center operations by providing a single pane of glass from which you can view, operate, and manage geographically-dispersed hybrid-cloud environments, all using an as-a-Service consumption model managed by Cisco with a focus on sustainability. Nexus Cloud provides visibility into ACI or NX-OS based data center fabrics, including topology and inventory, anomalies and advisories, conformance, and fabric upgrade assistance with an emphasis on simplifying security and compliance operations for network operators.

The Nexus Cloud API is a programmatic interface that uses the REST architecture to provide access to the Nexus Cloud functionality. API requests may be read-only with no permanent changes to the environment or read-write to allow you to configuration and modify the fabric resources. The response may confirm that some alteration has been made to the resource and it may provide hypertext links to related resources or collections of resources. The Nexus Cloud API accepts and returns messages that are encapsulated through JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents and uses HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) as the transport protocol.
