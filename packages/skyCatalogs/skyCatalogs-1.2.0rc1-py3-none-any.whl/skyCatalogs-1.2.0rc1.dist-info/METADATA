# The skyCatalogs package

This package will contain 
* code to create sky catalogs from input like cosmoDC2 (for galaxies) and similar catalogs for other source types
* implement an API to access information in the catalogs and products, such as flux calculations, derived from the catalogs

Sky Catalogs are chiefly intended for use by simulation programs. The physical representation is meant to compactly represent information needed to compute fluxes at a given time, under specified conditions (e.g. band).

## Set-up and testing
From bash
```
$ source <skyCatalogs install directory>/setup/setup.sh
$ nosetests <skyCatalogs install directory>
```
