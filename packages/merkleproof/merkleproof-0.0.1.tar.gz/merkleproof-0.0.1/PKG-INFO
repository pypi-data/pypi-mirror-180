*Build merkle trees, create merkle proofs, verify that the merkle root (hash root) can be reconstructed. The typical things you would do with a merkle tree.*

### Creating merkle trees, merkle proofs and verifying their consistency

* Simple package aimed at learning to work with merkle trees, produce proofs, etc.
* Built to be able to generate proofs that can be used in tandem with Solidity contracts.
* Follows OpenZeppelin's practices regarding produced merkle trees and proof output.

```pycon
>>> tree = MerkleTree(["a", "b"])
>>> tree.root
'fb8e20fc2e4c3f248c60c39bd652f3c1347298bb977b8b4d5903b85055620603'
```

### Work in progress

Note that this is under development and should not be used outside of a developer setting.
